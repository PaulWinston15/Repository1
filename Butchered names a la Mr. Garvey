Sean and only with this spelling. How does this spelling give me the same pronunciation as Shawn or Shaun? It should be pronounced like Bean. You know Sean Bean should be pronounced Seen Bean.
Saoirse. The name is Irish and I never would have pronounced it right if I didn't hear it on TV
Carolina. This one depends on the person's ethnicity. White people pronounce it Caro-Line-uh and latin speaking countries pronounce it Caro-Lean-uh.
Joaquin. It took me years to properly pronounce my friend's name. It doesn't help that the name is originally Arabic in origin. Mary's father, as in the virgin Mary, is named Joachim and it's pronounced Joe-a-Chim
Ned. For some reason, I pronounced it as Need in my youth.
Kireina. My niece's name. There are 3 ways to pronounce her name and I called my uncle to get the correct pronounciation. Why does she have this name? Because her parents wanted to give her a non-traditional name.
Geoff. I always thought the Geo was pronounced like Geode or Geodude. I never would have guessed this to be an alternate spelling for Jeff.
